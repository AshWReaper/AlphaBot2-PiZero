# AlphaBot2-PiZero
Some code to get AlphaBot2 from WaveShare working better... Mainly based on their 'demo' code, with some additions, improvements and reductions where needed.

Oh... and I also added a file (PS4C_LJS.py) that allows you to control the AlphaBot2 using a PS4 controller... I just haven't taken the time to note the key mapping, or how to bind the controller to the raspberry pi... Will get to this when I have time.. basically, you just need to bind the contoller to the pi (using bluetooth) and once the controller is switched on and successfuly attached to the pi, run the program using sudo python PS4C_LJS.py

P.S. Not really any good at using Github, so you may have to bare with me, whilst I make a few rookie errors down the line...
